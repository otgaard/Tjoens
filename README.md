Tjoens
======

A demo and experiment in interactive visualisation combining Typescript, WebGL, Web Audio, and React/Material.ui.

Try it out here: https://otgaard.github.io/Tjoens/

Works on all major browsers and OSs except for Safari - of course.  It's due to the audio context being created outside
of the execution environment that authorised its creation.
